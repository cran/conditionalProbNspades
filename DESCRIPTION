Description: Provides some tabulated data to be be referred to in a discussion in a vignette accompanying my upcoming R package 'playWholeHandDriverPassParams'. In addition to that specific purpose, these may also provide data and illustrate some computational approaches that are relevant to card games like hearts or bridge.This package refers to authentic data from Gregory Stoll <https://gregstoll.com/~gregstoll/bridge/math.html>, and details of performing the probability calculations from Jeremy L. Martin <https://jlmartin.ku.edu/~jlmartin/bridge/basics.pdf>.
